# Tasmota-dimmer-switch
A generic touch dimmer flashed wit Tasmota

On AliExpress you can buy a wifi dimmer for mains voltage (110 or 220V) It's a brandles dimmer, but can be found here: Aliexpress page

It comes in a couple of forms, but sinds I live in Holland, I chose the EU style, single gang, 220V, White edition. 
It has a glass front plate with 3 proximity/touch switches (On/Off, dimm up & dimm down) and a wifi indicator LED.

The inside houses 2 PCB's; a power board and a control board.
